MMAP allows a program to manipulate the virtual memory. It is used to map a virtual address space to hardware memory or can map the page to a file. It is also used to read a file into virtual memory (mainly text files).

LONGJMP and SETJMP are mainly used like a try and cathc block. SETJMP saves the environment in a "context" while LONGJMP causes the "context" to be restored from the SETJMP.
